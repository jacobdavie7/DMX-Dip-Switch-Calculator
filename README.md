Enter 0 or 1 to denote if each dip switch is on or off. The program will then calulate the DMX address and draw a picture of what the switches should look like for troubleshooting.

Note: This does not take into account an "on" / "active" / "enabled" dip switch. If your light has one, ensure it to set to the on position and ignore that switch when entering in values and the swtich drawing.
